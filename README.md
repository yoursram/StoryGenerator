A Wild Circus Adventure
A Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS Hackathon Project

This project is an AI-powered, interactive story generator built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It offers a dynamic "Choose Your Own Adventure" experience with procedurally generated plots, character-driven narratives, and real-time visual updates—all running directly in the browser without any external frameworks or libraries.

Key Features
Procedural Narrative: Every playthrough is unique! The game dynamically combines different characters, plot points, and settings to create a new story each time, ensuring high replayability.

Personality-Driven Choices: Your decisions matter. The game adapts the choices you're given and the story's direction based on the "personality" it detects from your previous actions.

Dynamic Visuals: The HTML <img> tag is used to display captivating, story-relevant images that change with each new plot development, providing a rich, immersive visual experience.

Kid-Friendly Theme: The project uses a vibrant and playful circus theme, with fun colors and fonts to create an engaging experience for a younger audience.

How to Run the Project
Running this project is straightforward and requires no complex setup.

Clone or Download the Repository: Get all the project files (index.html, style.css, script.js, and the images folder) onto your computer.

Open with Live Server: The simplest way to run the project is by using a tool like Live Server in VS Code. Simply right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server."

Open the File Directly: Alternatively, you can open the index.html file directly in your web browser by double-clicking it. Note that some browsers might have restrictions on loading local files, so Live Server is the recommended method.
